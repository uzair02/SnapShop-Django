# Final Year Project (FYP) - Product Search and Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my Final Year Project (FYP), **SnapShop** â€” a comprehensive product search and recommendation system. This project enables users to search for products using three methods:
1. **Text Search**
2. **Barcode Search**
3. **Image Search**

The image search feature is powered by a custom-trained YOLOv8 model, with all aspects managed by me, including data gathering, cleaning, annotation, and model training.

## Features

### Search Options
- **Text Search**: Search for products using text input.
- **Barcode Search**: Look up products by scanning barcodes.
- **Image Search**: Leverages a YOLOv8 model to recognize products from images, with the full data preparation and model training pipeline handled in-house.

### Price Scraping
- **Scrapy**: Used for scraping product prices across various sources.
- **Selenium**: Integrated with Scrapy for JavaScript-driven pages and dynamic content scraping.

### Additional Features
- **Profile Customization**: Users can manage their profiles, including:
  - A **recommendation system**
  - **Wishlist** management
  - **Product and store reviews**

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Built with React, located in the `frontend` folder.
- **Backend**: Built with Django, located in the `backend` folder.

## User Experience
Users can choose their preferred search method (text, barcode, or image) to locate a product. The system then displays results with prices from different sources. Users have options to manage their profiles, wishlist, review products, and stores, or proceed with purchasing.
